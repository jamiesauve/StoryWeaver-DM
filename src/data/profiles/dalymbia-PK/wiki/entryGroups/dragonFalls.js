  //     `One of the most talented transmutation students ever, when he graduated, transmuted the rock around the crest of Dragon Falls into a large dragon’s head, with the stream pouring out of its mouth. (Leaving one’s transmutation mark on Dragon Falls upon graduation is something of a tradition, though this is often done at night when not sanctioned by the picky professors - they only allow the highest-honored few students to do it). The people liked it so much that they refused to let the transmutation professors revert it, so it has remained until now. In a garden somewhere around the Cauldron is a statue of the student in the middle of a fountain, with green Tourmalines for eyes.`,
  //     `The Cauldron sides are lined with ledges, paths, waterfalls and small ponds. The school, Crystal Academy, is responsible for most of this. Dragon Falls is an almost impossibly picturesque place because of their attentions.`,
